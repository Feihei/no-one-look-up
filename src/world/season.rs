//! Season parameter table (ADR-0004 §6, R3.5).
//!
//! Pure data on purpose, like [`crate::world::placement`]: a season resolves to
//! four numbers (leaf density, foliage colour, sway strength, sway speed) and
//! nothing here touches the ECS or the GPU, so the table can be asserted
//! headless.
//!
//! # Why the density is a geometry collapse, not an alpha cut
//!
//! The original Godot project shipped alpha-carded foliage: `ALPHA = texel.a *
//! leaf_density`, so winter simply made the cards transparent. The Bevy trees
//! are opaque baked meshes ([`crate::world::tree_mesh`]) with no texture and no
//! alpha channel, so that path is gone.
//!
//! Drawing the foliage with alpha would also be wrong for a second, subtler
//! reason: Bevy's depth prepass decides alpha discard from the *material* base
//! colour (`render/pbr_prepass_functions.wesl`,
//! `prepass_sample_color_and_alpha_discard`), never from a vertex colour. The
//! volumetric fog and the cloud pass both read that prepass depth. A per-vertex
//! alpha would therefore erase foliage in the colour pass while leaving it
//! solid in the depth buffer — visible as fog and clouds cut out around
//! invisible leaves.
//!
//! So `leaf_density` instead collapses each foliage vertex toward its own
//! cluster centre in the vertex shader. At 0 the clusters become points and the
//! bare branch skeleton is all that remains, which is exactly the winter look
//! ADR-0004 asks for — and the collapse happens before the vertex position is
//! written, so the main pass, the prepass and the shadow pass all agree.
