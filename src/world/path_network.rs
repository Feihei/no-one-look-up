//! Block-first world generation (ADR-0002/0004, ported from the original
//! M2/M3 algorithms).
//!
//! Algorithm: the map is partitioned into rectangular blocks (merged cell
//! groups, block-first — blocks are the positive shape, streets are the
//! negative space between them). Street unit edges are the grid lines between
//! blocks, minus the lines between adjacent outer-band cells (the enclosure
//! band is never crossed by streets). Full partitioning plus the band rule
//! guarantees every street forms a cycle: with a complete rectangle
//! partition, an interior lattice vertex cannot have street degree 1, and
//! border vertices only see band-internal (excluded) edges — so there are no
//! dead ends. Both properties are asserted by unit tests.
//!
//! Determinism: a single `rand_chacha::StdRng::seed_from_u64(seed)` drives
//! every decision in a fixed cell-scan order; `thread_rng` never enters the
//! generation path. Same seed → bit-exact world (unit tested).
