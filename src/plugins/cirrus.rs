//! Cirrus: high, thin, wispy cloud rendered as a shaded sky dome (R5.6).
//!
//! Why not the volumetric layer: cirrus sits at 6-12 km and reads as a flat
//! sheet with essentially no parallax, so marching it as volume pays for depth
//! nobody can see. Its defining look is stretched fibre, which is exactly what
//! 2D noise stretched along one axis produces and what volumetric noise is
//! worst at. A dome shader is a fraction of the cost.
//!
//! Why a mesh rather than a full-screen pass: the dome goes through the normal
//! mesh pipeline, so the depth buffer occludes it behind buildings and trees
//! for free. A full-screen post-process pass cannot see depth (its render pass
//! has no depth attachment), and would paint cirrus over the street.
//!
//! The dome is a large inverted sphere that follows the camera. Its own
//! rotation is fixed, so the cloud pattern stays put in world space as you walk
//! (that is what makes it read as "high up" rather than "stuck to the lens").
